  ## Installation
  Installation
  You’ll need to use the express-handlebars package to implement Handlebars.js for your Views, use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

  You’ll also need the dotenv package to use environment variables, the bcrypt package to hash passwords, and the express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages to add authentication.

  Note: The express-session package stores the session data on the client in a cookie. When you are idle on the site for more than a set time, the cookie will expire and you will be required to log in again to start a new session. This is the default behavior and you do not have to do anything to your application other than implement the npm package.
